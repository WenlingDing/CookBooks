My project: Cookbooks


UX
Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.
In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:



As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

For this project, the goal is to provide an easy to use recipe repository website for users to view and contribute recipes. The target users of my website will be those who are looking for a particular recipe or simply browsing for an interesting receipe to cook.

There are 3 key features for this project
Feature 1 - Search recipe
Feature 2 - View recipe
Feature 3 - Maintain recipe

Feature 1 - Search recipe
As a user, I want to see all available recipes in the website so that I can view all recipes 
As a user, I want to be able to search the recipes by country or cusine so that I can narrow down the recipe I am looking for
As a user, I want to be able to view receipes in order of recipe name,  author, cusine or date so that I can have an ordered view

Feature 2 - View recipe
As a user, I want to be able to select and view a recipe in a single page so that I can see more information about the recipe

Feature 3- Maintain recipe
As a user, I want to be able to add new recipe in the website so that I can contribute to the website
As a user, I want to edit a recipe so that I can update the recipe
As a user, I want to be able to delete a recipe so that I can remove an outdated recipe 

Features
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

Existing Features
Feature 1 - Search recipe
The design is focus on simplicity yet fully functional to achieve the goal of the project.
For the home page, I decided to display all available recipes along with a short introduction and key attributes of a recipe for eg. type of cusine i.e "Italian"to showcase the recipe library and to immediately draw the interest of a user. There is also a simple to use search function right at the top along with filters and order mechanism to allow a user to find the recipe he/she desire conveniently 

Feature 2 - View recipe
If the user has interest in a recipe, he/she can click view more to see the ingredients and process to make the recipe. Through this design, i hope to interact with user to not only search a recipe he/she have in mind but to explore what other recipe options the website can offer to encourage repeat visits.

Feature 3- Maintain recipe
For the maintenance of recipe, I provide 3 main functions to do so:
1. Add recipe - A  user can add recipe through a form and submit to the website
2. Edit recipe - A user can make changes to the recipe to update it where necessary
3. Delete recipe - A user can delete an outdated recipe


Features Left to Implement
Another feature idea
1. Upload photos function - For recipe
2. Enhance the search function to have an advanced search filter 
3. User login function


Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.
Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
