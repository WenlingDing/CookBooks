UX
--
my entity relationship diagram is in todo_mysql/entityRalationship.png.
Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.
In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

For this project, the goal is to provide an easy to use recipe repository website for users to view and contribute recipes. The target users of my website will be those who are looking for a particular recipe or simply browsing for an interesting receipe to cook.

There are 3 key features for this project

Feature 1 - Search recipe
Feature 2 - View recipe
Feature 3 - Maintain recipe

Feature 1 - Search recipe
As a user, I want to see all available recipes in the website so that I can view all recipes 
As a user, I want to be able to search the recipes by country or cusine so that I can narrow down the recipe I am looking for
As a user, I want to be able to view receipes in order of recipe name,  author, cusine or date so that I can have an ordered view

Feature 2 - View recipe
As a user, I want to be able to select and view a recipe in a single page so that I can see more information about the recipe

Feature 3- Maintain recipe
As a user, I want to be able to add new recipe in the website so that I can contribute to the website
As a user, I want to edit a recipe so that I can update the recipe
As a user, I want to be able to delete a recipe so that I can remove an outdated recipe

Feature 1 - Search recipe
The design is focus on simplicity yet fully functional to achieve the goal of the project.
For the home page, I decided to display all available recipes along with a short introduction and key attributes of a recipe for eg. type of cusine i.e "Italian"to showcase the recipe library and to immediately draw the interest of a user. There is also a simple to use search function right at the top along with filters and order mechanism to allow a user to find the recipe he/she desire conveniently 

Feature 2 - View recipe
If the user has interest in a recipe, he/she can click view more to see the ingredients and process to make the recipe. Through this design, i hope to interact with user to not only search a recipe he/she have in mind but to explore what other recipe options the website can offer to encourage repeat visits.

Feature 3- Maintain recipe
For the maintenance of recipe, I provide 3 main functions to do so:
1. Add recipe - A  user can add recipe through a form and submit to the website
2. Edit recipe - A user can make changes to the recipe to update it where necessary
3. Delete recipe - A user can delete an outdated recipe
